# Bunny Hunt 

Merged some of the Unity FPS tutorial assets, but switched the weapon projectiles from doing damage to delivering live-attenuated vaccines with simplified Sabin-like polio vaccine properties of shedding, reversion, immune boosting, etc.

The bunnies still hop around in search of food and water, but they also can now transmit infections -- both vaccine strain (blue) and reverted virulent (red) -- to other nearby bunnies!
